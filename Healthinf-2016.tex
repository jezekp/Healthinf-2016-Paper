\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent 
There are lot of factors affecting human health. Factors such as genetics, environmental influence or internal state of an individual cannot be easy measured. On the other hands there are factors as blood pressure, glucose level or heart rate that can be measured relatively easy, non-invasively by cheap sensors. For a long time electrophysiological experiments have been conducted in laboratories equipped by common desktop computers and non-transferable measuring devices. Fortunately situation is rapidly changing in these days. The one of reasons is increasing popularity of smart devices as phones or tablets. According to eMarketer \cite{emark} two billions of people will own a smart-phone in 2016. Simultaneously a lot of relatively cheap sensors for measurement of potentials from the human body is available on the market. These sensors often transfer data wirelessly, it means they can be easily read and processed by smart devices. The obtained data can be used by two fundamental intersecting ways. 

The first assistive technology approach serves to stimulating, maintaining or improving functional capabilities of people with special needs including disabled people or aging population. Getting independence and self-sufficiency increases quality of life in general. 

The second approach is focused on sportsmen or actively living people. Measurements are based on a monitoring of persons when they are performing specific activities (e. g. running or long distance walking). The data are used to display the current status and a long term monitoring of the fitness level. 

We operate a complete equipped laboratory \cite{10.3389/fninf.2014.00020} for electrophysiology measurements. We are focused  mainly on Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-related potentials (ERP). Except of the fixed laboratory we also operate a so-called mobile laboratory equipped by a set of laptops and portable measuring devices for performing experiments out of the laboratory. With advancing efforts for extension the laboratory to collect broader spectrum of data (e. g. blood pressure, Elektrocardiogram (EKG), glucose level, heart rate) we are proposing here a prototype of mobile client for collecting data from wireless devices. The client provides API for connecting to limited set of devices available on the market and enables synchronization with the remote storage.

\section{\uppercase{state of the art}}
\label{sec:state-of-the-art}

\noindent
Neuroinformatics community identified problems with a long-term description, storage and management of experimental data/metadata \cite{CRCNS}. As a member of International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) \cite{INCF} we are being developing a system for long term storage and management of EEG/ERP experiments - EEGBase \cite{ISI:000306821100004}. A mobile EEG-Base client \cite{10.3389/conf.fninf.2013.09.00046} is a supplementary Android tool that enables collecting experiments out of the laboratory and provides an on-line synchronization with EEGBase.
 
 According to \cite{Lowe2012242} appliactions using sensors can be divided into three categories. The first category Smart Phone Applications use either GPS or the
onboard kinematic sensors as the technologies of choice for monitoring exercise. The second category comprises of any system that uses a central controller
and an external sensor. The last category comes from image processing domain. It uses a combination of a computer screen and a camera. The camera monitors the exact movement and position of the entire body during exercise. The screen is used for interaction with the user.

The first category represents application such as Endomondo or Runkeeper. The second category Nike+, miCoach, Garmin Heart Belt or Fora Active tonometer. The typical representative of third category is Microsoft Kinect.

While Microsoft Kinect is designed for the indoor use all other devices are designed mostly for the outdoor use.
